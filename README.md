# FRC-Scouting-Application

This is a repository containing the source code to my FRC Scouting Application, this Application is an open source program
which users can persoanlly edit on their systems.

Rules to this:

*Do not take code, and claim as your own
*Do not take code, slightly edit, and claim as your own
*Do not take credit, especially during FRC judging on this program, whether or not you have edited the program
*Do not take code, and post it anywhere else

Note: I ask these things just out of respect, I am making this program to help FRC teams that do not have the time or 
recourses to create an effective FRC Scouting Application for PC systems. If users do not have the recourses to edit the 
themselves, but still wish for certian features, users may message me requesting possible features. This does not mean 
that the feature will be added, this only means that I will take the suggestion into considering when discussing with myself
on how to make the app much more adequate to the demands of the FRC community.
